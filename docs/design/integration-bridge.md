# Integration Bridge Layer Design

## Purpose
Connect and coordinate all system components, providing unified configuration, monitoring, and control interfaces.

## Core Responsibilities
- **Component Lifecycle**: Initialize, connect, and teardown layers
- **Configuration Management**: Unified config across all layers
- **Monitoring & Metrics**: System-wide performance tracking
- **Error Handling**: Fault isolation and recovery
- **API Gateway**: External interface for applications

## Key Components

### Component Manager
- Service discovery and registration
- Dependency resolution
- Health checking
- Graceful shutdown coordination

### Configuration System
- Centralized configuration store
- Hot-reload capability
- Environment-specific overrides
- Validation and type safety

### Metrics Collector
- Performance counters from all layers
- Aggregated statistics
- Real-time dashboards
- Historical data for analysis

### Error Recovery
- Circuit breakers for failing components
- Fallback strategies
- Error propagation rules
- Automatic restart policies

## System Integration Points

### API Surface
```
- REST API for configuration and control
- WebSocket for real-time streaming
- gRPC for high-performance IPC
- CLI for command-line management
```

### Plugin Architecture
```
- Dynamic loading of agent types
- Custom scheduling strategies
- Rendering extensions
- Transport protocols
```

## Data Flow Coordination

### Message Pipeline
```
Agents → Transport → Orchestration → Renderer → Terminal
         ↑                                       ↓
         └──────── Integration Bridge ──────────┘
                    (monitoring/control)
```

### Control Flow
```
Configuration → Bridge → All Layers
Metrics ← Bridge ← All Layers
Errors ← Bridge ← All Layers
```

## Performance & Reliability

### Monitoring Metrics
- Message throughput (msgs/sec)
- End-to-end latency (µs)
- Buffer utilization (%)
- Agent concurrency (#)
- Error rates (errors/sec)

### Failure Modes
- **Transport failure**: Buffer and retry
- **Orchestrator failure**: Pass-through mode
- **Renderer failure**: Fallback to basic output
- **Bridge failure**: Components continue autonomously

## External Interfaces

### Application Integration
- Library API for embedding
- Process spawning and management
- Inter-process communication
- Remote agent support

### Observability
- Prometheus metrics export
- OpenTelemetry tracing
- Structured logging
- Debug command interface
