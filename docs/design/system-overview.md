# Perdix System Architecture Overview

## Vision
A high-performance, GPU-accelerated system for managing multiple AI agents outputting to a single terminal without visual chaos.

## System Layers

### 1. Transport Layer âœ… (Complete)
**Purpose**: Zero-copy, lock-free message passing between GPU and CPU
- **Technology**: CUDA unified memory, ring buffer
- **Performance**: 2-3 GB/s throughput, <1Î¼s latency
- **Status**: Implemented and tested

### 2. Orchestration Layer ðŸš§ (Planned)
**Purpose**: Coordinate multiple AI agents to prevent output conflicts
- **Key Features**: Scheduling, merging, flow control
- **Challenge**: Balancing fairness with responsiveness
- **Goal**: Handle 100+ concurrent agents

### 3. Terminal Renderer ðŸš§ (Planned)
**Purpose**: Efficient terminal output without screen tearing
- **Key Features**: ANSI processing, differential updates
- **Challenge**: Platform compatibility (Unix/Windows)
- **Goal**: 60+ FPS smooth rendering

### 4. Integration Bridge ðŸš§ (Planned)
**Purpose**: Connect all components with unified control
- **Key Features**: Config, monitoring, error handling
- **Challenge**: Zero-overhead coordination
- **Goal**: Seamless component interaction

## Problem Being Solved

**Current State**: Multiple AI agents writing to terminal simultaneously causes:
- Screen tearing and corruption
- Lost output from overlapping writes
- Terminal crashes from buffer overflows
- Poor user experience

**Solution**: Perdix provides:
- **Ordered Output**: Agents can't corrupt each other's output
- **Fair Scheduling**: All agents get terminal time
- **High Performance**: GPU acceleration for massive throughput
- **Visual Stability**: No tearing or artifacts

## Key Design Principles

1. **Performance First**: GPU acceleration throughout
2. **Zero-Copy**: Minimize data movement
3. **Lock-Free**: Avoid contention bottlenecks
4. **Modular**: Each layer can evolve independently
5. **Observable**: Rich metrics and debugging

## Use Cases

### Primary: AI Agent Multiplexing
- Multiple Claude/GPT agents in single terminal
- Parallel task execution with readable output
- Real-time streaming without conflicts

### Secondary Applications
- Log aggregation from distributed systems
- Multi-process debug output
- High-frequency trading terminals
- Gaming server consoles

## Success Metrics

- **Throughput**: >10M messages/second
- **Latency**: <10ms end-to-end
- **Concurrency**: 100+ simultaneous agents
- **Visual Quality**: Zero tearing/artifacts
- **Reliability**: 99.99% uptime
